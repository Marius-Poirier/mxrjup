Where <em>IGOR</em> was a polished persona, this album is raw, exposed, and glitchy.</p><p>The production draws heavily from industrial noise and classic soul samples, creating a friction that shouldn't work but does.</p><blockquote>\"It's chaos, but controlled chaos. Like a orchestrated car crash.\"</blockquote><p>Essential listening for anyone tracking the trajectory of modern hip-hop.</p>",
